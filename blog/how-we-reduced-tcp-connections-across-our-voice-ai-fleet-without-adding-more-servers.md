title: How We Reduced TCP Connections Across Our Voice AI Fleet Without Adding More Servers

Recently, while looking at our WebSocket server fleet, we noticed something interesting.

A few months ago, each pod would routinely show hundreds of TCP connections across states like `ESTABLISHED`, `TIME_WAIT`, and `CLOSE_WAIT`. Today, despite handling similar or higher traffic volumes, those numbers have dropped significantly.

This wasn't the result of reducing traffic. It was the result of systematically eliminating connection inefficiencies across the stack.

## The Symptom

Our WebSocket servers sit at the center of a real-time Voice AI platform. Every active call maintains multiple long-lived streams while simultaneously interacting with LLMs, STT providers, TTS providers, databases, caches, and internal services.

When we first started scaling, a typical pod would accumulate large numbers of TCP connections:

- Hundreds of active (`ESTABLISHED`) connections
- Large `TIME_WAIT` counts
- Growing `CLOSE_WAIT` counts
- Periodic connection resets

None of these are inherently bad, but at scale they create pressure on:

- File descriptors
- Kernel networking resources
- Memory consumption
- Connection setup latency
- Upstream services

Over time, we realized that many of these connections were avoidable.

## Root Cause #1: LLM Connections Were Not Being Reused

One of the biggest contributors was outbound LLM traffic.

Originally, many requests would create fresh HTTP connections to model providers. While the requests themselves were fast, repeatedly performing TCP and TLS handshakes created unnecessary connection churn.

Every new connection introduces:

1. TCP handshake
2. TLS negotiation
3. Socket allocation
4. Kernel bookkeeping

Across thousands of requests, this adds up quickly.

The fix was straightforward:

- Introduce persistent HTTP clients
- Enable connection pooling
- Reuse existing keep-alive connections whenever possible

Instead of opening a new connection for every request, requests now share a pool of warm connections.

One subtlety worth calling out: we intentionally kept these pooled clients on HTTP/1.1 rather than HTTP/2. HTTP/2 multiplexes many requests over a single connection, which sounds ideal,  but in a voice pipeline, generations are frequently cancelled mid-stream when the caller interrupts the agent (barge-in). Under HTTP/2, those abrupt cancellations left streams in a bad state and leaked connections back into the pool. Sticking with pooled HTTP/1.1 connections gave us clean per-request lifecycles and the connection reuse we were after, without the cancellation hazard.

The result was a substantial reduction in both connection creation rate and `TIME_WAIT` accumulation.

## Root Cause #2: Better HTTP Connection Pooling Across Services

The LLM client wasn't the only place where connections were being recreated.

Over time we audited interactions with:

- Internal APIs
- Telephony providers
- STT services
- TTS services
- Observability systems

Several integrations were creating short-lived HTTP sessions that could be reused.

By standardizing on shared async HTTP clients and connection pools, we reduced:

- TCP handshakes
- TLS renegotiations
- Connection teardown events

This not only reduced connection counts but also improved request latency because many requests were sent over already-established sockets.

## Root Cause #3: Stale WebSocket Connections

The most impactful improvement came from cleaning up stale WebSocket sessions.

In real-world telephony systems, connections do not always close cleanly.

Examples include:

- Carrier-side disconnects
- Mobile network drops
- Browser/network interruptions
- Provider timeouts
- Process crashes

Without aggressive cleanup, these stale sessions can remain attached to resources far longer than necessary.

We introduced:

- Better heartbeat monitoring
- Idle connection detection
- Faster cleanup of orphaned sessions
- More reliable disconnect handling

As a result:

- Dead sockets stopped lingering
- Memory usage became more predictable
- Connection counts more accurately reflected active traffic

## What the Numbers Look Like Today

A recent snapshot from our production WebSocket fleet showed:

- Roughly 75–90 established connections per pod
- Limited `TIME_WAIT` accumulation
- Low `CLOSE_WAIT` counts
- Very few connection resets

More importantly, the distribution across pods is relatively uniform, indicating that traffic is being balanced effectively.

The total number of connections across the fleet is dramatically lower than what we observed several months ago.

## Why This Matters

Connection efficiency is one of those optimizations that rarely shows up in product demos but has a disproportionate impact on reliability.

Reducing unnecessary connections means:

- Lower memory consumption
- Fewer open file descriptors
- Less kernel overhead
- Reduced TLS handshake costs
- Better latency
- Higher effective pod capacity

In distributed systems, scaling is often less about adding more machines and more about making better use of the connections you already have.

## Key Takeaway

The improvement wasn't the result of a single optimization.

It came from many small fixes accumulated over time:

- LLM connection pooling
- Reusable HTTP clients
- Better keep-alive usage
- Cleanup of stale WebSocket sessions
- More disciplined connection lifecycle management

Individually, each change seemed minor.

Collectively, they significantly reduced the number of active TCP connections across our Voice AI infrastructure while improving stability and resource efficiency.

Sometimes the best scaling win isn't handling more traffic. It's needing fewer connections to handle the same traffic.
