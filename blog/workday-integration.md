If you have ever applied for a job or been involved in hiring, you know the early steps can be overwhelming. A single job post might get hundreds of applications. Reviewing each one and reaching out takes time and often slows everything down. To manage this better, many companies use an Applicant Tracking System. It helps teams organize applications, track progress, and store candidate details. But even with these systems, early screening is still done manually.

Recruiters scan resumes to guess who might be a good fit. A resume, however, doesn’t show how someone communicates or how genuinely interested they are. This can lead to great candidates being missed and time spent on poor matches.

That is where Bolna helps. It acts as AI recruiting software by using voice-based AI to engage with candidates, ask important questions, and quickly deliver insights. It connects with the ATS platforms to automate early screening and help your team move faster. In this blog, you will learn how Bolna’s voice AI powers smarter hiring through seamless Workday [integration](https://blog.bolna.ai/bolna-plivo-integration/), improving speed and accuracy at scale.

## What is an ATS and Why it Matters

When companies start receiving hundreds of job applications, staying organized becomes a real challenge. It’s not just about reading resumes. It’s about keeping track of every candidate, their stage in the process, and how they were sourced. Applicant Tracking Systems, or ATS platforms, help solve this. They bring all application data into one place so hiring teams can post jobs, review candidates, schedule interviews, and manage everything without switching tools. 

Platforms like Workday, Greenhouse, and Lever are popular ATS choices. While ATS platforms help teams stay organized, they don’t offer much insight into the people behind the resumes. They manage data but can’t show how someone communicates or how engaged they are. To bridge that gap, organizations often turn to smarter tools for early screening.

## Introducing Bolna

[Bolna](https://www.bolna.ai/) is a Voice AI platform that helps teams improve the way they screen candidates. It is designed to make hiring more efficient, more personal, and easier to manage, especially when dealing with large volumes of applications.

It uses AI-powered voice agents that speak directly with candidates. These agents ask role-based questions, check communication skills, or simulate real-world scenarios. They are available 24/7, can speak multiple languages, and handle many conversations at the same time. This helps teams connect with more people without delays or extra effort. Instead of relying only on resumes, recruiters get a clearer view of each person. They can understand how someone speaks, how confident they sound, and how well they fit the role. Candidates also stay engaged and receive quicker responses throughout the process.

Bolna fits into the ATS your team already uses to manage hiring. It connects with platforms for scheduling, communication, and tracking applicants, without requiring any major changes. Behind the scenes, it uses powerful AI to run conversations and works smoothly with calendars, CRMs, and applicant tracking systems. 

This level of integration enhances your workflow and positions Bolna as a smart addition to any recruiting automation software setup, especially when you are handling high volumes of candidates.

## What Happens Without Automation

Let’s look at an example. Company X is hiring for a Customer Support Executive role across several cities. They use Workday to manage their hiring pipeline and track applications from different sources.

In just one week, they receive over 2,000 applications through platforms like LinkedIn and Naukri. It’s a strong start, but the team knows the hardest part is still ahead. Without automated resume screening, recruiters begin reviewing resumes manually. Many look the same. Some are incomplete. Others seem promising but lack enough detail. To get clarity, they start calling candidates one by one to ask about availability, experience, and interest. These calls take time and slow the team down.

As the volume grows, delays set in. Good candidates don’t respond fast enough. Others lose interest. Despite their best efforts, top talent starts slipping away.

Workday helps organize applications, but it isn’t built for early screening at scale. It can’t talk to candidates or assess how they communicate. [Bolna Voice AI](https://www.bolna.ai/docs/introduction) fills this gap with voice-based automation that screens applicants quickly and sends insights directly into the workflow. This helps recruiters focus on the right people and move faster with more confidence. It also offers a practical way to automate the hiring process and reduce the manual workload that slows teams down.

## Step-by-Step: Bolna and Workday Integration

Company X can connect Bolna Voice AI directly with their Workday account to take a smarter approach to hiring. Setting up Bolna to handle [AI-powered interview calls](https://www.bolna.ai/docs/api-reference/calls/make) is quick and doesn’t require changing the team’s existing workflow. The integration fits smoothly into their current hiring systems and processes.

Let’s see how this works step-by-step.

### Step 1: Applications are collected in Workday

Candidates apply through job boards, career pages, or referrals. All their details, such as name, phone number, and job title, are automatically captured and stored inside Workday. The company’s existing application process stays the same, with no changes needed at this stage.

### Step 2: Bolna connects to Workday using API access

Bolna connects to Workday using API access to ensure the Workday integration is smooth and secureThere are two ways to set this up:

- **Direct connection via Workday API: **Use developer credentials to fetch candidate data securely.

- **Third-party connectors**: The [Nango platform](http://nango.dev/api-integrations) offers no-code or low-code integration options that simplify API connectivity and manage data syncing automatically.

The Workday API enables Bolna to retrieve and update candidate records automatically by keeping your hiring workflow current without any manual effort.

### Step 3: A voice agent is created inside Bolna

Recruiters log into Bolna’s dashboard to create a voice agent for the role. No coding is needed.

&nbsp;They simply:

- Select a pre-built template

- Customize the screening questions if needed

- Activate the agent with a single click

The agent is ready to hold real, smart conversations with candidates.

### Step 4: Bolna automatically calls candidates

Using synced phone numbers from Workday, Bolna begins calling candidates. The voice agent speaks naturally, handles interruptions, and adjusts based on candidate responses. Calls can happen in real-time or be scheduled in batches, allowing dozens or hundreds of conversations at once.

### Step 5: Voice AI analyzes the responses

Bolna listens and processes each conversation instantly.&nbsp; It captures key traits like tone, fluency, confidence, and role fit.&nbsp; Instead of raw answers, recruiters get structured insights they can use to make decisions faster.

### Step 6: Results flow back into Workday

After each call, Bolna generates:

- A conversation summary

- A fit score based on screening criteria

- Notes, alerts, and action points

- Full transcripts, if needed

All insights are synced back into Workday using [Bolna APIs](https://www.bolna.ai/docs/api-reference/executions/get_execution) or even [webhooks](https://www.bolna.ai/docs/polling-call-status-webhooks), keeping everything organized in one place. Recruiters can review, filter, and act on candidates without leaving their ATS.

## Why integrating Bolna with Workday is a smarter way to hire

Integrating Bolna with Workday brings the benefits of AI recruiting software to your hiring process, adding speed, intelligence, and consistency without changing how your team already works. Here’s why it makes a real difference.

- **Everyone gets screened:** Manual calling limits how many people you can screen. Bolna ensures every applicant gets a fair, consistent conversation within hours, not days.

- **Less manual work:** No more back-and-forth scheduling or repetitive screening calls. Bolna handles all early conversations so recruiters can focus on decision-making.

- **Better candidate understanding:** Voice calls reveal tone, confidence, clarity, and intent details that don’t show up on paper. Bolna captures and analyses all of it instantly.

- **Stays in your system:** All candidate conversations, scores, and next steps stay linked to your ATS. No switching tools or losing context between systems.

- **Easy to scale up:** Whether you’re hiring 20 or 2,000, Bolna helps you handle the load without adding pressure to your existing team or process.

### The Risk of Staying Manual

Relying only on manual screening can slow your hiring when it matters most. Candidates today expect fast responses and clear communication. Delays can cause top talent to lose interest or accept offers elsewhere before you even reach them. Without smart automation, even great teams can fall behind. Valuable time is spent chasing resumes, making calls, and managing hundreds of conversations by hand. Modern hiring needs a faster, more reliable way to screen and connect with candidates. Adding Bolna voice AI to your workflow can make all the difference.

## Make Hiring Simpler, Faster, and Smarter

Screening candidates does not have to be slow, manual, or stressful. With Bolna and Workday integration, your team can move faster, talk to more candidates, and make better choices without changing how you already work.
