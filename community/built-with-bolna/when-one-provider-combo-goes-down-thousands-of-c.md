## The Uncomfortable Truth About Voice AI at Scale

Sudarshan Kamath, founder of Smallest AI, said something recently that stuck with me:

> "The thing that breaks real-time voice agents in production usually isn't model quality. It's control. Rent a popular real-time model through an API and you inherit its latency spikes, its costs, its bad days - none of it tunable when a call is live."
> 

He's right. And the problem runs deeper than most people realize.

When you're running voice AI at scale, you're not just depending on one external provider. You're chaining three of them together - every single call. Speech-to-text, a language model, text-to-speech. Each one a potential point of failure. Each one having its own bad days, its own latency spikes, its own outages.

And here's what makes it dangerous: **you probably won't know when it happens.**

## How Bolna's Pipeline Actually Works

Bolna powers voice agents for collections, recruitment, outbound sales, and customer support - across Hindi, Hinglish, Tamil, Telugu, and more. Every call runs through a chain of three providers:

- **ASR** (speech-to-text) - Deepgram Nova-2, Sarvam Saaras-v2, Azure Whisper
- **LLM** (language model) - OpenAI GPT-4o, DeepSeek V3, Groq LLaMA 3.3
- **TTS** (text-to-speech) - ElevenLabs, Cartesia Sonic-2, Sarvam Bulbul-v2

That's 20+ unique provider combinations running simultaneously, across thousands of calls every day.

Each combination has its own latency profile, its own failure modes, its own good days and bad days. And they behave completely differently from each other.

---

## The Problem: Aggregate Metrics Lie

Here's a scenario that happens more often than anyone admits:

Your average latency across all calls today is 820ms. Dashboard is green. Everything looks fine.

But `sarvam + deepseek + elevenlabs` - running 800 calls today - just spiked to 2200ms. That spike gets averaged away across all your other healthy combos. Your monitoring shows nothing. Your SRE team sees nothing.

Meanwhile:

- A collections agent's transcription starts failing mid-sentence. The customer says "hello" and gets silence. They hang up.
- A recruitment bot slows down during a campaign. Candidates hear awkward pauses, lose trust, drop off before screening completes.
- An outbound sales team's conversion rate quietly dips. Nobody can explain why.

Your customers notice before your engineering team does. That's the real cost.

## What Canary Analysis Looks Like for Voice Infra

In traditional software engineering, canary analysis means catching regressions in a small subset of traffic before they affect everyone. For voice AI pipelines, the equivalent is **per-combo drift detection** - watching each provider combination independently, against its own historical baseline.

This is the idea behind BolnaMonitor.

Instead of one global latency average, it tracks every unique ASR+LLM+TTS combination separately. Each combo builds its own 24-hour baseline. The moment a combo's recent performance diverges from that baseline - statistically, not just by a fixed threshold - it fires an alert.

The distinction matters: a naturally slower combo (say, a multilingual model) shouldn't constantly trigger warnings. And a fast combo that suddenly slows down should get caught immediately. Per-combo baselines make both possible.

---

## How the Detection Works

The core is a Z-score computed per combination:

`z = (recent_mean - baseline_mean) / baseline_std`

In plain English: how many "standard deviations" away from normal is the current latency for this specific combo?

| Z-Score | Probability of False Alarm | What It Means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.5 | 1.2% | Likely real anomaly |
| 3.0 | 0.27% | Almost certainly real |
| 4.0+ | 0.003% | Definitely real |

An alert fires when any of these three conditions are met:

| Condition | Threshold |
| --- | --- |
| Statistical drift | Z-score > 2.5 vs 24h baseline |
| Absolute latency | Total end-to-end > 2000ms |
| Error rate | > 5% empty transcripts or failures in last 30 min |

Three independent signals. Any one of them is enough to surface the combo as degraded.

---

## What It Looks Like in Practice

Here's a real example from the live dashboard:

**`sarvam → deepseek → elevenlabs`**

- 24h baseline: 877ms
- Last 30 min: 2242ms
- Z-score: **4.1 → CRITICAL**
- Error rate: 15.0%
- ASR: 263ms | LLM: 395ms | TTS: 219ms *(the LLM is the culprit)*

**`azure → openai → azure`**

- 24h baseline: 1100ms
- Last 30 min: 1521ms
- Z-score: **2.2 → WARNING**
- Error rate: 8.8%

Every other combo: green.

Without per-combo tracking, both of these disappear into a healthy-looking aggregate. With BolnaMonitor, they surface in under 30 minutes - broken down by which component (ASR, LLM, or TTS) is actually causing the spike.

## What This Means for Bolna's Customers

This isn't just an infrastructure concern - it maps directly to business outcomes.

| Without monitoring | With BolnaMonitor |
| --- | --- |
| Customer complains → engineering investigates | Alert fires in ~30 min, before customer notices |
| Hours finding root cause in aggregate logs | Dashboard shows exactly which combo broke and when |
| All combos suspected, no clear answer | Per-component breakdown shows LLM is the culprit |
| SLA breach, customer churn risk | Proactive fix, customer never impacted |

For a collections team running 500+ calls/day, catching one major provider degradation early can be the difference between hitting recovery targets and missing them entirely.

## Integration: One Webhook URL

Bolna already fires a detailed webhook after every call - with provider names, per-component latency, errors per turn, all inside `meta_info`. BolnaMonitor just listens to that:

`https://bolna-monitor.onrender.com/webhook-receiver/webhook`

No SDK. No code change in Bolna's stack. No new dependency. Just a webhook URL added to the existing config.

The monitor extracts ASR, LLM, and TTS provider info and latency from each call, stores it, and runs drift detection continuously. The moment a combo crosses any of the three alert thresholds, it shows up on the dashboard.

---

## Current Limitations - Being Honest

BolnaMonitor is a working prototype. Here's what a production version would need:

- **Push alerts** - Slack or PagerDuty, so you don't have to watch a dashboard
- **Time-of-day aware baseline** - afternoon traffic is naturally higher; comparing vs same hour yesterday reduces false positives
- **Per-language tracking** - Hindi and English calls have different latency profiles and should be tracked separately
- **PostgreSQL** - SQLite works for a demo, not for production traffic at Bolna's scale
- **Schema validation** - if Bolna's webhook payload changes, a validator catches it loudly instead of silently zeroing out fields

## Try It

The dashboard is live with demo data showing real drift scenarios across Bolna's actual provider stack - Sarvam, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Cartesia, DeepSeek, Groq, and more.
